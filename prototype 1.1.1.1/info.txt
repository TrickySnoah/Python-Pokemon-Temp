========= INFO =========

 * Found a way to use pynut to take keyboard inputs in a much better way than
   how pygame takes in keyboard inputs
 * Provided an example of how to implement the usage of pynput

 * Replace the necessary pygame keyboard inputs with pynut keyboard inputs

 * Start making the functions do things. pokemonList, pokedex, bag, success, and save can all be
   worked on later on once the pokemon, items, and more have all been created
